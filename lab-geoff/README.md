# Geoff's TCP Server

This project is a simple chat server app that allows telnet clients to connect and then interact with the server, and other clients by way of the server.

# Setup & Go

- Clone this repository, run `git clone https://github.com/geoffsimons/06-tcp-chat-server.git`
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- To startup the server: `node server.js [port]`
--`port` defaults to the PORT environment variable
- Use a telnet client to connect to the port
- Have fun...maybe you'll find an easter egg.
