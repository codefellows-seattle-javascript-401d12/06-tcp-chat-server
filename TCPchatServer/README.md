# Getting Started with the TCP chat Server

## About

This is very basic command line chat app. It was a lot of fun to build, and I know would be really cool to add to. This is super basic and  nowhere near as cool as it could be, it has a lot of possibilities and could be turned into a really cool project over the course of a weekend. I'm sure that a group of good friends, with a little bit of knowledge could come up with some pretty awesome things to make this more personalized and a whole lot of fun. Maybe someone will build off of it and have as much fun as I did making it. Enjoy!

## Getting up and running

To get started using this command line chat application, you'll first want to clone this repository. Once you have it cloned to your machine, run `npm install`.

## Connecting to the server

Once you've successfully cloned this repo, and installed the dependencies you can start using the application.

* Open a command line or terminal
* You'll want to go ahead and open up a few more tabs
* Go ahead and navigate to the root of the project
* In your first tab, run `node server.js`, you should be notified that the server has started.
* In the other two tabs run `telnet localhost 3000`
